# 2️⃣ Document Clustering 📝
## Objective:
Automatically group similar documents using unsupervised learning.

## Methods Used:

- Data Preprocessing: Removing punctuation, lowercasing, stopwords removal.
- Feature Extraction:
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
  - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT)
- Clustering Models:
  - K-Means
  - Agglomerative Clustering
  - LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
## Results & Insights:

Efficiently categorized documents based on their content similarity.
Can be used for organizing articles, news reports, and research papers.
## 📂 Files:

- Document_Clustering.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with the complete pipeline.
- data/ – Contains sample document datasets.
🔹 Usage:
Run the notebook and experiment with different clustering techniques.
