# 3️⃣ Image Quantization 🎨
## Objective:
Reduce the number of colors in an image while preserving its structure using K-Means clustering.

## Methods Used:

- Convert image pixels into numerical data (RGB values).
- Apply K-Means clustering to group similar colors.
- Replace original pixel values with their closest cluster centroid.
## Results & Insights:

Achieved significant color reduction while maintaining the visual essence of the image.
Useful for image compression, artistic effects, and efficient storage.
## 📂 Files:

- IMAGE_QUANTAZATION.ipynb – Notebook implementing the technique.
- images/ – Sample images used for testing.
🔹 Usage:
Load any image in the notebook and experiment with different cluster sizes (K).
